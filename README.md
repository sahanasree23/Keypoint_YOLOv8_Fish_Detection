# Keypoint_YOLOv8_Fish_Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a fish detection system using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model, optimized for detecting key points in various fish species. The project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify and locate fish in underwater images and videos, providing valuable insights for marine biology research and fisheries management.

##Features:
- Implementation of YOLOv8 for efficient and accurate fish detection.
- Keypoint detection to identify specific features of different fish species.
- Dataset creation using Roboflow for streamlined annotation and preprocessing.
- Pre-trained model weights and fine-tuning scripts.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples for easy setup and usage.

##Applications:
- Marine biology research
- Fisheries management
- Underwater robotics
- Environmental monitoring

##Acknowledgments:
- Dataset creation and annotation were facilitated by Roboflow.
